      After an initial foray into the ways that open-source software has failed
to live up to its early hype,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.filfre.net/2023/07/going-rogue/&quot;&gt;this Digital
Antiquarian article&lt;/a&gt; covers the history of rogue-like games in great
detail.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	This brings us back around to a statement I made at the outset:
	that roguelikes are the exception that proves the rule of
	open-source game development — and just possibly of open-source
	software development in general. The cast of thousands who
	contribute to them do so in order to make exactly the games that
	they want to play, which in the abstract is the best of all
	possible reasons to make a game. The experience they end up with
	is, unsurprisingly, much like high-wire programming at its most
	advanced, presenting players with an immense, multi-faceted system
	to be explored and mastered.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      Over the years, the kernel has developed a number of deferred-execution
mechanisms to take care of work that cannot be done immediately.  For many
(or most) needs, the &lt;a
href=&quot;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/core-api/workqueue.html&quot;&gt;workqueue
subsystem&lt;/a&gt; is the tool that developers reach for first.  Workqueues
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/355700/&quot;&gt;took their current form&lt;/a&gt; over a dozen years
ago, but that does not mean that there are not improvements to be made.
Two sets of patches from Tejun Heo show the pressures being felt by the
workqueue subsystem and the solutions that are being tried — with varying
degrees of success.

      The Fedora project is considering &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/fedora-devel/CAJqbrbeOZrHvYjvMCc=qGZD_VXBs3-qReeirr+F8t01Eq1sYhw@mail.gmail.com/&quot;&gt;a
Fedora&amp;nbsp;40 change proposal&lt;/a&gt; to add limited, opt-out telemetry to the
workstation edition.  The proposal is detailed; it is clear that the
developers involved understand that this will be a hard sell in that
community.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	We believe an open source community can ethically collect limited
	aggregate data on how its software is used without involving big
	data companies or building creepy tracking profiles that are not in
	the best interests of users. Users will have the option to disable
	data upload before any data is sent for the first time. Our service
	will be operated by Fedora on Fedora infrastructure, and will not
	depend on Google Analytics or any other controversial third-party
	services. And in contrast to proprietary software operating
	systems, you can redirect the data collection to your own private
	metrics server instead of Fedora's to see precisely what data is
	being collected from you, because the server components are open
	source too.

      <title>[$] BPF iterators for filesystems</title>

      <description>
      In the first of two combined BPF and filesystem sessions at the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/lsfmmbpf2023&quot;&gt;2023 Linux Storage, Filesystem,
Memory-Management and BPF Summit&lt;/a&gt;, Hou Tao introduced his BPF iterators
for filesystem information.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/926041/&quot;&gt;Iterators for
BPF&lt;/a&gt; are a relatively recent addition to the BPF landscape; they help
BPF programs step through kernel data structures in a loop-like manner, but
without running afoul of the BPF verifier, which is notoriously hard to
convince about loops.

      The transition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/849538/&quot;&gt;folios&lt;/a&gt; has transformed
the memory-management subsystem in a number of ways, but has also resulted
in a lot of code churn that has not been welcomed by all developers.  As
this work proceeds, though, some of the benefits from it are beginning to
become clear.  One example may well be in the handling of anonymous memory,
as can be seen in a pair of patch sets from Ryan Roberts.

      Ruihan Li has &lt;a
href=&quot;https://lwn.net/ml/oss-security/xhhkp3aknwwlmrmmqmr532yfq3ioqh6jbkrxfqf6ovlj2szsai@f3sjwakyq323/&quot;&gt;disclosed
a significant vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; introduced into the 6.1 kernel:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	A flaw was found in the handling of stack expansion in the Linux
	kernel 6.1 through 6.4, aka &quot;Stack Rot&quot;. The maple tree,
	responsible for managing virtual memory areas, can undergo node
	replacement without properly acquiring the MM write lock, leading
	to use-after-free issues. An unprivileged local user could use this
	flaw to compromise the kernel and escalate their privileges.
&lt;p&gt;
	As StackRot is a Linux kernel vulnerability found in the memory
	management subsystem, it affects almost all kernel configurations
	and requires minimal capabilities to trigger. However, it should be
	noted that maple nodes are freed using RCU callbacks, delaying the
	actual memory deallocation until after the RCU grace
	period. Consequently, exploiting this vulnerability is considered
	challenging.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The disclosure contains a detailed description of the problem.  Fixes have
been merged into &lt;a href=&quot;https://git.kernel.org/linus/9471f1f2f502&quot;&gt;the
mainline&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://lwn.net/Articles/937079/&quot;&gt;the 6.4.1, 6.3.11, and 6.1.37
stable kernel updates&lt;/a&gt;.

provides a Linux environment and terminal emulator for such devices. Most
command-line software can be used quite easily with Termux, 
and GUI software can be run by installing a few extra apps. It is an excellent
option for Android users who want to run Linux software occasionally on a
device more portable than a laptop but do not want to use a dedicated Linux
phone due to the cost or limitations of such devices.

      Joe &quot;Zonker&quot; Brockmeier has been a part of the Linux community for decades;
he is now using that experience to write a series on &quot;Red Hat and the Clone
Wars&quot;.  The first two episodes were &lt;a
href=&quot;https://dissociatedpress.net/2023/06/24/red-hat-and-the-clone-wars/&quot;&gt;Red
Hat and the Clone Wars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
href=&quot;https://dissociatedpress.net/2023/06/26/red-hat-and-the-clone-wars-ii-a-history-of-the-early-2000s-linux-landscape/&quot;&gt;A
history of the early 2000s Linux landscape&lt;/a&gt;; the latest is &lt;a
href=&quot;https://dissociatedpress.net/2023/07/03/red-hat-and-the-clone-wars-iii-the-dawn-of-centos/&quot;&gt;The
dawn of CentOS&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;bq&quot;&gt;
	In 2009, the main project admin for CentOS went radio
	silent. CentOS had been spun up in the wild west days of the
	Internet, when it seemed totally fine to let one person hold the
	domain, communications channels, and funds. Oops.
&lt;p&gt;
	Folks depending on CentOS suddenly had a Come to Jesus moment. What
	happens if your production systems depend on a project where the
	main admin is AWOL and you have no plan for that?
